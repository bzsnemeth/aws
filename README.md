# AWS Kubernetes Deployment with Terraform

## Project Overview

This project demonstrates the deployment of a high-availability Kubernetes cluster on Amazon Web Services (AWS) using Terraform. It showcases the use of AWS Elastic Kubernetes Service (EKS) to manage Kubernetes clusters across multiple regions, ensuring a resilient and scalable microservices architecture.

## Features

- Multi-region Kubernetes cluster deployment in AWS
- Infrastructure as Code (IaC) using Terraform
- Sample microservices application deployment
- Networking and security configuration for inter-cluster communication
- Monitoring and logging setup

## Prerequisites

- AWS Account with required permissions
- Terraform installed on your local machine
- Basic knowledge of Kubernetes and AWS services
- Git for version control

## Installation & Setup

### Step 1: Clone the Repository

git clone [repository-url]
cd [repository-name]

### Step 2: AWS Configuration

Set up AWS CLI and authenticate with your AWS account.
Ensure you have the necessary IAM roles and permissions.

### Step 3: Terraform Initialization

bash
Copy code
terraform init
This will initialize Terraform and download required providers.

### Step 4: Terraform Plan & Apply

bash
Copy code
terraform plan
terraform apply
This will show the plan and then create resources on AWS.

### Usage

Update the Terraform files according to your cluster and application requirements.
Deploy the changes using Terraform commands.
Access the Kubernetes cluster using kubectl to manage your applications.
